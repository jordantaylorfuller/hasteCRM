A next-generation Customer Relationship Management system powered by AI at every level, designed to automate and enhance sales processes beyond traditional CRM capabilities.

## ✅ AUTO-ACCEPTS READY

**This project is 100% configured for Claude Code with auto-accepts enabled:**
- Complete setup wizard included
- All configuration files pre-generated
- Mock services for development (no API keys needed)
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Documentation-first enforcement via .cursorrules

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical specifications complete
- ✅ **Architecture**: System design and patterns defined
- ✅ **Feature Planning**: 10-phase implementation roadmap created
- ✅ **Setup Wizard**: One-command setup ready
- ✅ **Auto-Accepts**: Fully configured for Cursor IDE
- ✅ **Mock Services**: Development without external dependencies
- 🔄 **Implementation**: Ready to start with Claude Code

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (2 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Run the setup wizard
./setup-wizard.sh

# 2. Start development
make start
```

### Enable Auto-Accepts in Cursor:
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+A` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux)
2. Look for green checkmark in status bar
3. Claude Code can now work autonomously!

1. **Review the Documentation** - Understand the planned architecture and features
2. **Contribute to Planning** - Help refine the specifications
3. **Start Implementation** - Use the documentation as a blueprint to begin development

### To Start Implementation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hasteCRM.git
cd hasteCRM

# Run the setup script to initialize the project structure
./scripts/initialize-project.sh

# This will create the basic monorepo structure outlined in Phase 1
```
