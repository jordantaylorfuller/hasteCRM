- ✅ Companies service
- ✅ Import/export service
- ❌ Missing: Companies resolver, specific import/export services

**Web Coverage**: Failing
- ⚠️ ContactList component (failing tests)
- ❌ Missing: ContactCard, ContactFilters components

### Phase 3: Gmail Integration

### Phase 4: AI Features
**API Coverage**: ~95%
- ✅ AI service (with mock mode)
- ✅ AI resolver
- ❌ Missing: Module configuration only

**Web Coverage**: None
- ❌ Missing: All AI UI components

### Phase 5: Pipeline Management
**API Coverage**: ~90%
- ✅ Pipelines service and resolver
- ✅ Deals service
- ✅ Pipeline analytics service
- ❌ Missing: Pipeline automation service, automation processor

**Web Coverage**: Failing
- ⚠️ PipelineBoard component (failing tests)
- ❌ Missing: DealCard, StageColumn components

### Phase 6: Production Preparation
**API Coverage**: ~95%
- ✅ Health checks (Prisma, Redis indicators)
- ✅ Health and metrics controllers
- ✅ Exception filters
- ✅ Error logging interceptors
- ❌ Missing: Health resolver

**Web Coverage**: Failing
- ⚠️ Error boundary (failing tests)
- ⚠️ Error page (failing tests)
- ✅ Loading page
- ✅ Not found page

## Key Issues to Address

### High Priority (Blocking 100% Coverage)
1. Fix all failing web app tests (23 tests)
2. Add workspace management tests (Phase 1)
3. Add pipeline automation tests (Phase 5)
4. Fix module configuration coverage (all phases)

### Medium Priority (Major Gaps)
1. Add missing resolver tests (companies, import/export, health)
2. Add all missing UI component tests
3. Add email parser and webhook services tests

### Low Priority (Minor Gaps)
1. Improve branch coverage in existing tests
2. Add edge case tests for error scenarios
3. Add integration tests between modules

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix the 23 failing web tests to establish a stable baseline
   - Add critical missing tests for workspace management
   - Complete pipeline automation testing

2. **Short-term Goals** (1-2 weeks):
   - Achieve 80% overall coverage
   - Ensure all critical paths are tested
   - Add UI component tests for all phases

3. **Long-term Goals** (3-4 weeks):
   - Achieve 95%+ test coverage
   - Add comprehensive integration tests
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows

## Summary

The project has a solid testing foundation with all API tests passing (501 tests). However, to achieve 100% test coverage:
- API needs ~40% more coverage (mainly modules and some services)
- Web app needs significant work (fix failures and add missing tests)
- Estimated effort: 10-12 days of focused development

The good news is that all critical authentication, data processing, and error handling paths are well-tested. The main gaps are in UI components and module configurations.
