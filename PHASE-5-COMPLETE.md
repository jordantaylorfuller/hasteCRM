## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: NestJS, Prisma, GraphQL, BullMQ
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, @dnd-kit, Apollo Client
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced schema design
- **Queue**: Redis with BullMQ for automation processing

### Key Design Patterns

- Repository pattern with Prisma
- Event-driven automation system
- Optimistic UI updates
- Modular service architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

### Performance Optimizations

- Efficient database queries with proper indexes
- Batch operations for bulk updates
- Queue-based automation processing
- Optimistic UI updates for drag-and-drop

## API Endpoints

### GraphQL Queries

- `pipelines` - List all pipelines
- `pipeline(id)` - Get single pipeline
- `pipelineMetrics(id, dateRange)` - Get pipeline analytics
- `deals(filters)` - List deals with pagination
- `deal(id)` - Get single deal
- `dealHistory(id)` - Get deal stage transitions

### GraphQL Mutations

- `createPipeline(input)` - Create new pipeline
- `updatePipeline(id, input)` - Update pipeline
- `deletePipeline(id)` - Delete pipeline
- `createDeal(input)` - Create new deal
- `updateDeal(id, input)` - Update deal
- `moveDeal(input)` - Move deal to different stage
- `bulkMoveDeal(dealIds, stageId)` - Bulk move deals
- `bulkUpdateDealOwner(dealIds, ownerId)` - Bulk assign owner

## Next Steps

With Phase 5 complete, the CRM now has:

- ✅ Authentication & Workspace Management (Phase 1)
- ✅ Contact & Company Management (Phase 2)
- ✅ Gmail Integration (Phase 3)
- ✅ AI Features (Phase 4)
- ✅ Pipeline & Deal Management (Phase 5)
