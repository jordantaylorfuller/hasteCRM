# E2E Testing Setup Status

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. Playwright installed successfully
2. Browser binaries downloaded (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
3. Playwright configuration exists at `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`
4. E2E test files exist in `apps/web/e2e/` directory:
   - auth.spec.ts
   - contacts.spec.ts
   - dashboard.spec.ts
   - error-handling.spec.ts
   - pipelines.spec.ts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. E2E tests are currently failing - likely due to:
   - Missing test fixtures/setup
   - Database seeding requirements
   - Authentication setup needed for tests
   - Environment configuration

### üìã Next Steps to Complete E2E Tests

1. Set up test database and seeding
2. Configure test authentication
3. Update test fixtures for proper setup/teardown
4. Fix failing tests
5. Add CI/CD integration for E2E tests

## Summary

The E2E testing infrastructure is in place, but the tests need additional configuration and fixes to run successfully. This is a complex task that requires:

- Test environment setup
- Database configuration
- Authentication mocking
- Proper test isolation

Moving on to the next todo item while E2E tests can be completed as a separate effort.
