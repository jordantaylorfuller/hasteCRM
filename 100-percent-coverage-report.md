   - Added missing EmailService methods (sendBulkEmails, sendTemplatedEmail)
   - Fixed email parser multi-recipient handling
   - Fixed PrismaModule test issues
   - Added getWebhookStats method to GmailWebhookService

2. **Achieved 100% Coverage in Key Areas**

   - PubSub Auth Guard: 100% coverage
   - Pipeline processors: 100% coverage
   - Gmail processors: 100% coverage
   - Health indicators: 96.55% coverage
   - Webhook services: 96.25% coverage

3. **Added Comprehensive Test Suites**
   - 150+ new API tests
   - 200+ new Web tests
   - Complete test coverage for all GraphQL operations
   - Full coverage for pipeline automation service
   - Comprehensive webhook recovery service tests

## 🔧 Remaining Work

### API (To reach 100%)

1. **Low Coverage Areas**:

   - src/common/utils: 45.97% (needs utility function tests)
   - src/modules/email: 31.42% (needs email module tests)
   - src/modules/contacts: 64.02% (needs more resolver tests)
   - src/modules/import-export: 70.93% (needs export service tests)

2. **Failing Tests** (6 remaining):
   - Pipeline automation service (date matching issues)
   - Gmail webhook service (metrics key format)
   - Companies resolver (optional parameter handling)

### Web (Significant work needed)

1. **Failing Tests**: 96 tests failing

   - Dropdown menu component issues
   - Portal rendering problems
   - Async state update handling

2. **Component Issues**:
   - UI components need proper mocking
   - GraphQL operations need better error handling
   - Form components need validation tests

## 📈 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. Fix remaining 6 API test failures
2. Add tests for low-coverage utilities and services
3. Mock Radix UI components properly for Web tests
4. Handle async operations in React components

### Long-term Strategy

1. Set up coverage thresholds (minimum 90%)
2. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent coverage regression
3. Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Create coverage badges for README

## 🏆 Achievements

Despite not reaching 100% coverage yet, significant progress was made:

- API coverage improved from ~61.9% to ~80%
- Web tests infrastructure established
- Critical services now have comprehensive test coverage
- All GraphQL operations are tested
- Authentication and authorization fully tested

## 📝 Technical Debt Addressed

- Fixed multiple test environment issues
- Improved mock strategies
- Established consistent testing patterns
- Resolved async testing challenges
- Fixed TypeScript type issues in tests

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining API Tests** (Est. 1-2 hours)

   - Update date expectations to use matchers
   - Fix service method calls
   - Handle optional parameters correctly

2. **Improve Utility Coverage** (Est. 2-3 hours)

   - Add tests for all utility functions
   - Test error handling paths
   - Cover edge cases

3. **Fix Web Component Tests** (Est. 4-6 hours)

   - Mock Radix UI properly
   - Handle portal rendering
   - Fix async state updates

4. **Add Missing Service Tests** (Est. 3-4 hours)
   - Email service full coverage
   - Import/Export service tests
   - Contact resolver edge cases

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Test Environment Matters**: Many failures were due to environment setup
2. **Mocking Strategy**: Consistent mocking patterns prevent many issues
3. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of promises and timers is crucial
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript in tests catches many potential issues
5. **Coverage != Quality**: Focus on meaningful tests, not just numbers
