## Recommendations

### High Priority (Security & Core Features):

1. **Authentication Coverage**:

   - Complete testing for OAuth flows
   - Add tests for password reset functionality
   - Cover 2FA implementation thoroughly

2. **Gmail Integration**:

   - Test OAuth token refresh logic
   - Cover sync error scenarios
   - Add tests for webhook recovery

3. **Page Components**:
   - Add comprehensive tests for all page components
   - Focus on user interactions and error states

### Medium Priority (User Experience):

1. **UI Components**:

   - Complete coverage for dialog, dropdown, and select components
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality in PipelineBoard

2. **Import/Export**:
   - Add resolver tests for all mutations
   - Cover error handling scenarios

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):

1. **Type definition files** (no action needed)
2. **Export barrel files** (minimal value in testing)

## Test Improvement Strategy

1. **Focus on Critical Paths**: Prioritize authentication, Gmail sync, and core business logic
2. **Error Scenarios**: Add tests for error handling and edge cases
3. **Integration Tests**: Consider adding more integration tests for complex workflows
4. **UI Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests for all page components
5. **Branch Coverage**: Focus on improving branch coverage by testing conditional logic

## Conclusion

While the project has good overall coverage (API: 89.1%, Web: 87.88%), there are critical gaps in authentication, Gmail integration, and page components that should be addressed to ensure production readiness.
