## 4. Requirements to Achieve 100% Coverage

### API Testing Requirements

**Priority 1 - Critical Missing Tests** (estimate: 2-3 days):

1. All module configuration files (\*.module.ts)
2. Workspace management module and tests
3. Pipeline automation service and processor
4. Webhook recovery service
5. Email parser service
6. Email account service

**Priority 2 - Low Coverage Services** (estimate: 2 days):

1. Companies resolver
2. Import-export resolver
3. Gmail webhook service
4. Google OAuth strategy
5. Health resolver

**Priority 3 - Coverage Improvements** (estimate: 1-2 days):

1. Increase auth.service.ts coverage to >90%
2. Increase contacts.service.ts coverage to >80%
3. Increase two-factor.service.ts coverage to >80%
4. Complete email.service.ts testing
5. Fix uncovered branches in existing tests

### Web Testing Requirements

**Priority 1 - Fix Failing Tests** (estimate: 1 day):

1. Fix React hooks issue in error.test.tsx
2. Mock @hello-pangea/dnd for PipelineBoard tests
3. Fix auth-context test failures
4. Resolve error-boundary test issues
5. Fix ContactList component tests

**Priority 2 - Missing Core Tests** (estimate: 3-4 days):

1. Authentication UI components (login, register, 2FA)
2. Contact management components (Card, Filters)
3. Email UI components (list, thread, composer)
4. Pipeline UI components (deal card, stage management)
5. AI feature UI components

**Priority 3 - Integration Tests** (estimate: 2 days):

1. End-to-end authentication flows
2. Contact CRUD operations
3. Email sync and display
4. Pipeline drag-and-drop functionality
5. AI features integration

## 5. Summary & Recommendations

### Current State

- **API**: 60% overall coverage with 501 passing tests
- **Web**: ~56% tests passing, significant gaps in UI testing
- **Total Effort**: Approximately 10-12 days to achieve 100% coverage

### Immediate Actions Required

1. Fix all failing web tests before adding new ones
2. Add tests for all module configurations (quick wins)
3. Complete workspace management tests (Phase 1 gap)
4. Implement pipeline automation tests (Phase 5 gap)
5. Add comprehensive UI component tests

### Coverage Goals by Priority

- **Week 1**: Fix failing tests, add module tests, reach 75% API coverage
- **Week 2**: Add missing service tests, implement UI component tests, reach 85% overall
- **Week 3**: Complete integration tests, edge cases, achieve 95%+ coverage

### Technical Debt

- Module configuration files lack tests across all phases
- Web app has significant testing gaps
- Some services have very low coverage despite being core features
- Integration between phases needs better testing
